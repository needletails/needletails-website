Swift on the server (Vapor, Hummingbird, SwiftNIO) typically uses less memory and delivers more requests per core than many popular runtimes. That means you can serve the same traffic on smaller or fewer instances—so your cloud bill drops without sacrificing reliability.","costSavingsWhyItMatters":"Over a year, choosing a more efficient runtime can cut your server bill by hundreds or thousands of dollars for the same workload. The comparison below is a realistic ballpark for a simple JSON API serving roughly 1–2 million requests per month on a single small cloud instance.","costSavingsSubhead":"Same workload: a typical API serving about 1–2 million requests per month on one small cloud server.","costSavingsTableHowToRead":"Memory use drives how big a server you need. Traffic capacity is how many requests one server can handle.
